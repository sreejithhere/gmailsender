Dear {first_name},
<br>
<br>
<b>Economic Times</b> in a survey discovered that 60% rejections in an interview were attributed to non verbal elements 
and lack of clarity. As Indians, there is an inherent focus on knowledge and the soft skills are largely 
ignored.
<br>
<br>
Certain basic questions like - &quot;Tell me about yourself&quot; is enough to steer the entire course of 
the interview.
<br>
<br>
Our expert Dipika Singh helps prepare for such basic nuances of the interview which surely will be better 
equipped to deal with interviews with a mix of the right amount of knowledge and soft skills.
